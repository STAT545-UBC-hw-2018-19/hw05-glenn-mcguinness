# Homework 05: Factor and figure management

This repository contains my submission for homework 5 in STAT 545A. The goal of this assignment is described as follows:

> Goals:
> 
> - Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
> - Write some data to file and load it back into R.
> - Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
> - Make a plotly visual.
> - Implement visualization design principles.

The submission for this assignment is an html document, as this is the only way to display the required plotly plot.
